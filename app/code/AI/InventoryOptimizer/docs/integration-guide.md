   - **Connection Failed**: Check the error message for details on what went wrong

### Common Connection Issues

- **Invalid Credentials**: Double-check your API key and secret
- **Network Issues**: Ensure your server can reach the external API
- **API Limits**: Some systems have rate limits that may affect the test
- **IP Restrictions**: Some APIs only accept connections from whitelisted IPs

## Managing Data Synchronization

Once your integration is configured, you can manage the synchronization process:

### Manual Synchronization

1. Go to **AI Inventory > External Integrations**
2. Find your integration in the list
3. Click **Sync Now** to manually trigger synchronization
4. The system will import and export data according to your configuration
5. Once complete, you'll see a summary of the results

### Automatic Synchronization

The system will automatically synchronize data based on your configured frequency. You can monitor these automatic syncs:

1. Check the **Last Sync** column in the integration grid
2. Review the AI Inventory logs for detailed synchronization information
3. Set up email notifications for sync issues in the configuration

### Selective Synchronization

For more control, you can synchronize specific data:

1. Go to **AI Inventory > External Integrations**
2. Click **Advanced Sync** for your integration
3. Select what to synchronize:
   - **Import Inventory**: Get latest inventory from external system
   - **Export Inventory**: Send Magento inventory to external system
   - **Import Orders**: Get latest orders from external system
   - **Export Orders**: Send Magento orders to external system
4. Optionally set filters (date range, SKUs, etc.)
5. Click **Start Sync** to begin the process

## Warehouse Mapping

A critical part of integration setup is mapping your Magento inventory sources to external system warehouses:

### Setting Up Warehouse Mapping

1. In your integration configuration, find the **Warehouse Mapping** field
2. Enter one mapping per line in the format: `magento_source_code=external_warehouse_id`
3. For example:
   ```
   default=WH1
   east_coast=EAST01
   west_coast=WEST02
   ```
4. Save the configuration

### Verifying Warehouse Mapping

To ensure your warehouse mapping is correct:

1. Go to **AI Inventory > External Integrations**
2. Click **Test Warehouse Mapping** for your integration
3. The system will verify that all mapped warehouses exist in both systems
4. Any issues will be displayed for you to resolve

## Monitoring Integration Status

Keep track of your integrations' health and performance:

### Integration Dashboard

The External Integrations page provides a quick overview:

1. **Status Indicator**: Shows if the integration is connected and functioning
2. **Last Sync Time**: When the last synchronization occurred
3. **Sync Statistics**: Number of items synchronized in the last operation
4. **Error Count**: Number of errors encountered during synchronization

### Detailed Logs

For more in-depth information:

1. Go to **AI Inventory > System > Logs**
2. Select the **Integration Logs** tab
3. Filter by integration name to see specific activity
4. Review logs for warnings, errors, or informational messages

### Performance Metrics

Monitor the efficiency of your integrations:

1. Go to **AI Inventory > Reports > Integration Performance**
2. View metrics such as:
   - Average sync time
   - API call volume
   - Error rates
   - Data consistency score

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Inventory Discrepancies

If inventory levels don't match between systems:

1. Check the **Last Sync Time** to ensure a recent synchronization
2. Verify warehouse mapping is correct
3. Look for failed sync operations in the logs
4. Run a manual sync with the **Force Full Sync** option enabled

### Order Synchronization Issues

If orders aren't properly synchronized:

1. Verify order statuses included in synchronization
2. Check for order validation errors in the logs
3. Ensure customer data mapping is correct
4. Test with a single order using the **Test Order Sync** feature

### Connection Timeouts

If synchronization fails due to timeouts:

1. Increase the **Connection Timeout** setting
2. Reduce the **Batch Size** to process fewer records per request
3. Check if the external system is experiencing performance issues
4. Verify your server has sufficient resources

### Authentication Failures

If the integration suddenly stops working:

1. Test the connection to verify credentials are still valid
2. Check if API keys have expired or been revoked
3. Verify IP restrictions haven't changed
4. Ensure the external system account is in good standing

   ```xml
   <type name="AI\InventoryOptimizer\Model\IntegrationRegistry">
       <arguments>
           <argument name="integrations" xsi:type="array">
               <item name="your_integration_code" xsi:type="string">Your\Module\Model\Integration\YourIntegration</item>
           </argument>
       </arguments>
   </type>
   ```
4. Implement the required methods:
   - `getCode()` and `getName()`
   - `isEnabled()` and `initialize()`
   - `testConnection()`
   - `importInventory()` and `exportInventory()`
   - `importOrders()` and `exportOrders()`
   - `getStatus()`

## Best Practices
